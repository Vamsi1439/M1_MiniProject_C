Test Plan

With this mini project in C Telecom Billing System, you can perform and manage billing operations like they do in Telecom companies. Here, you can add records with name, phone number and the amount of payment. You can view, modify, search and delete existing records.
You can also make payment by providing your phone number instead of name. All data added or modified are recorded in a file. This project will teach you how to add, list, edit, search and delete records using file handling.
This mini project is a console application without graphics. It is compiled in Visual studio code IDE using GCC compiler. So, compiling the source codes in other platforms or compiler such as Turbo C will produce errors.


The functions and features used in this project are listed below:

Add new records: add new data into file with name, phone number and amount to be paid

Modify records – edit the added records; name, phone number and/or amount of payment can be edited
